I have always enjoyed people watching. On my morning runs, I imagine the different but similar lives of the people passing. The people passing have smart phones, smart headphones, smart watches; they can reach the world with a swipe or a button or a quick vocal command. 

I want to understand how those smart devices connect - to other devices, to people, to the world. I want to interact with our devices, especially as reliance on computers and their usefulness becomes more integrated with our lives. I want to make lives better, not just a few but many. I believe the best way to do so is through software engineering, to interact and develop the devices we so rely on. 

With just the first steps undertaken so far, I have been challanged and frustrated. But nothing beats the feeling when the code works and the pieces start to come together. You start to look at the 'Netflix' button on the remote and wonder how the remote talks to the TV and how exactly it knows you're pushing the 'Netflix" button and not a different one. How does the smart watch know how many bench press reps you've completed? And you start to realize this exciting journey to learn software engineering is just the beginning of understanding the world around us, the tools at our disposal, and all the incredible possibilities.
