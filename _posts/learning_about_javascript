The Javascript project for FlatIron's bootcamp is our 4th module. The most challenging part of this project was taking a step back and breathing when I hit a roadblock. I hit an error or bug and would get too into my head to dig myself out of the hole. I would take a break for an hour that would stretch into days, afraid to attack the bug or the problem. Once I did get back to the bug, I found the issue wasn't nearly as diasterous as I had originally thought and could be solved through in just a bit of time. As long as I took a breath and thought through the problem, instead of wildly clicking or guessing, I could dig myself out of the hole in no time. 

The lessons learned? Take a deep breath while coding. Believe in your skills and your network of fellow engineers. Don't walk away from a problem for too long. Keep coding, keep working, keep learning!
