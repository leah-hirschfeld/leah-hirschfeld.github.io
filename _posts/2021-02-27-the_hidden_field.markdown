The title of this post sounds very exciting. The hidden field! What is that? How fun!

The hidden field tag in the form_for builder is an incredibly useful tool. It allows the developer to add information that may otherwise be lost or challenging to connect together, like user information or an id for an instance of a connecting class. It should be noted that even though this field *is* hidden from the user, the input field can be seen through developer tools and could be modified by an unscrupulous individual. 

During the ruby on rails project for the FlatIron School, I couldn't figure out how to create two instances of a class and ensure the instances would be saved to my database. I continued to get 'instance of model 1 must exist' or 'instance of model 2's user must exist' and could not determine what was causing my issue. I thought nested forms - which allows the developed to associate and make two objects at once - would resolve my issue. Instead, I needed to include my user's information in the hidden field tag to make sure my objects knew who created them. With the help of a wonderful classmate and some guidance from my cohort lead, I was able to move on from the errors I was receiving and utilize the hidden field correctly! 

The ruby on rails project was by far the most challenging one we've had to date. I got a taste of it during our Sinatra project, but there are an enormous number of moving parts when building out a ruby on rails project - even with all the wonderful built-in methods and generators that ruby on rails has to offer. I have a better understanding of the flow of a web application and a deeper appreciation for the incredibleness of code and computers.
