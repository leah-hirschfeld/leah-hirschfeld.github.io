My first glance at the CLI Project included a "woof". I couldn't imagine I had the skillset to build out the CLI Project and interact with a web based data set (the Studio Ghibli API). Getting the CLI to the 'base' level of passing the project was fine: going one level deep in a straight forward list of films. But I decided to add some dimensionality (with the sort_by commend) to the code organization. I listed the movie titles alphabetically, in ascending order by rotten tomato score and ascending order by year. 

Once that was complete, I decided to tackle directors. I wanted to have a list of the 6 Studio Ghibli directors and when a user asked for more information about the director, for the list to expand to provide each film by that director and a description. I added a Director class and utilized the class relationships we'd been taught to get all the classes to interact! 

My next goal is to install a Gem for Awesome Print and play with the formatting in the CLI to make it even more user friendly. It's extremely exciting to have the skills to build out a complete project. Thank you, Flatiron!
